# Building a WordPress Site with Vultr VPS in 2025: A Practical Guide

Looking to launch your online presence without breaking the bank or dealing with overcomplicated hosting platforms? Here's the thing: most people think setting up a website on a VPS is rocket science. It's not. You just need the right server and a straightforward approach.

This guide walks through using Vultr VPS to get your WordPress site runningâ€”from server setup to installation. We'll cover the common hiccups (like IP blocks and SSL setup) and show you two paths: the control-freak route with server panels, and the "just make it work" one-click method.

## Why Vultr Makes Sense for WordPress Hosting

Vultr's been around since 2014. I've used their services for nearly a decade, and they keep delivering on the basics that matter.

**Stability You Can Count On**

![Vultr billing history showing consistent service usage](image/196045582.webp)

Nearly 10 years of billing records tell a simple story: the servers stay up. Their tech updates arrive on schedule, and you're not constantly putting out fires.

**Performance That Actually Performs**

I ran some tests comparing Vultr to other providers. Same specs: 1 core, 512MB RAM.

![Performance comparison between Vultr and RamNode VPS](image/993633131152417.webp)

The numbers:
- Vultr scored 899 with 450 MB/s disk I/O
- Legacy RamNode: 626.9 score, 652 MB/s disk I/O  
- Current RamNode: 700+ score, but only 149.6 MB/s disk I/O

Vultr beats both versions in overall performance and comes with more storage. Need even more power? Their High Frequency plans start at $6/month.

**32 Data Centers Worldwide**

![Global map showing Vultr's 32 worldwide data center locations](image/171768881.webp)

Vultr's got locations across Americas, Europe, Australia, Asia, and Africa. **32 data centers total**. For online businesses selling internationally, this matters more than you'd think.

Here's why: put your server close to your customers, and pages load faster. Faster sites = happier visitors = better conversion rates. Pretty straightforward math.

> **Note for China-based access:** Vultr doesn't optimize routes for mainland China users, so expect slower speeds if you're accessing from there. If speed is critical, consider these alternatives with CN2 routes: [1H1G1T](https://blog.naibabiji.com/go/bwh-cn2-1g), [2H2G2T](https://blog.naibabiji.com/go/bwh-cn2-2g), [2H1G1T](https://blog.naibabiji.com/go/bwh-cn2giae-211). Use code: BWH34QMFYT2R

**Support That Actually Responds**

In all my years using Vultr, I've never needed to open a support ticket. The servers just work.

That said, when people do contact support, response times are solid. More importantly, Vultr keeps their tech currentâ€”when new Linux versions drop, they update quickly. Not every provider bothers.

Their documentation library is extensive (though admittedly more useful if you read English). Still, comprehensive docs signal a company that takes their product seriously.

Plus, they accept Alipay. If you don't have an international credit card, that's huge.

## Getting Started with Vultr

Vultr uses hourly billingâ€”pay only for what you use. Like prepaid phone credit: top up your account, server runs and charges by the hour. Stop the server, stop the charges. Each plan has a monthly cap. Perfect for testing or temporary projects.

[Click here to register and get $300 in trial credits](https://www.vultr.com/?ref=9738262-9J)

**Step 1:** Register through the link above to claim your $300 credit. (New users only. Requires credit card or PayPal. Credits valid for 30 days)

![Vultr account registration page](image/455013065668.webp)

**Step 2:** **Verify your email**. Check your inbox (and spam folder if needed). No email? Try a different address and register again.

![Email verification prompt](image/51965624190038.webp)

**Step 3:** After email verification, log into Vultr. Go to **Billing** on the left sidebar and **add $10 using any payment method** (required to activate trial credits).

![Billing payment options screen](image/793836638.webp)

WeChat Pay is no longer available. For domestic users, Alipay remains an option. However, trial credits only apply when paying with credit card or PayPal. Remember: 30-day expiration on those credits.

## Server Deployment and Management

Account registered, payment addedâ€”now we build.

### Creating Your Server

![Deploy new server interface](image/508914416.webp)

Click **Products** on the left, then the **+ button** in the top right. Select **Deploy New Server** from the menu.

1. **Server type:** For standard websites, **Shared CPU** works fine. Want more performance? Go with **Dedicated CPU**.

2. **Location:** Choose the data center closest to your target audience.

3. **Plan:** Start with **1 CPU, 2GB RAM** ($10/month minimum). Budget tight? The $6/month option works temporarily, though WordPress runs better with more memory. (WordPress officially recommends PHP 8.3+ and MySQL 8.0+ or MariaDB 10.6+â€”newer versions need more RAM.)

![Server configuration options](image/51448408907.webp)

4. Click **Configure Software** at the bottom right to continue. (The **Automatic Backups** option above costs extra but provides peace of mind. Budget-conscious? Skip it and handle backups manually using [WordPress backup plugins](https://blog.naibabiji.com/tutorial/wordpress-bei-fen-cha-jian.html).)

![Additional server features selection](image/389652876.webp)

> **Pro tip:** [Test which Vultr location offers the best speed](https://blog.naibabiji.com/news/vultr-ce-su.html) for your use case. Remember: optimize for your customers' access speed, not yours. If it's slow for you, use a VPN. Your customers matter more.

**Choose the data center nearest your target customers.** They get faster load times (you might need that VPN thoughâ€”customers come first).

5. **Select Operating System**

![Operating system selection screen](image/827405202067.webp)

Recommended: **Debian 12**

**Important note:** This guide shows the standard approach (clean OS + manual environment setup). If that sounds like too much work, skip to the [one-click WordPress installation section](#one-click-wordpress) below.

6. **Launch the server**

![Final deployment configuration](image/7596879127030300.webp)

Leave **Hostname** and **Label** blank or add English labels to identify your servers. In **Additional Features**: choose Automatic Backups if you want them, **definitely enable IPv4**, IPv6 is optional, consider Limited User Login for security. Then hit **Deploy**.

### Managing Your Server

Server's running. Time to set up the website environment. (Quick ad: Don't want to do this yourself? I'll handle the complete setup for $198. [Contact me here](https://blog.naibabiji.com/contact).)

First, install management software: [Free VPS management tools Xshell6/Xftp6 Chinese version](https://blog.naibabiji.com/files/xshell-xftp.html) (Mac users: your built-in Terminal worksâ€”no separate guide for Mac since I don't have one)

![Vultr server details and credentials](image/0537537160220.webp)

Click into your server's detail page. In **Xshell**, click **New** and enter your **server IP** in the host field.

![Xshell connection setup](image/94664472799571.webp)

Click **Connect**. A prompt appearsâ€”click **Accept and Save**.

![SSH key verification prompt](image/6522373536512952.webp)

**Note:** If this prompt never appears, try pinging your server IP. No response? Probably blocked. Delete the server (destroy it), create a new one. Sometimes you'll create 10+ servers before finding an unblocked IPâ€”that's normal with Vultr these days.

![Xshell login credentials](image/30744708528922.webp)

Enter the credentials from your Vultr dashboard to connect. Success looks like this:

![Successful server connection](image/570896471824.webp)

You're in. Next: installing the web environment.

### Installing a Server Panel

For beginners, server panels simplify everything. We'll use one here. (Alternative: [one-click WordPress installation](#one-click-wordpress) if you're only running a single site.)

**First, register for a panel account** (free registration button in top right):

[Register for panel account](https://www.bt.cn/u/MECE6g)

After registration, return to Xshell. Copy this command, right-click in Xshell to paste (hit Enter if it doesn't execute):

```bash
wget -O install.sh https://download.bt.cn/install/install-ubuntu_6.0.sh && sudo bash install.sh ed8484bec
```

(The screenshot shows CentOS, but use the command above for Debian 12. [Video tutorial available](https://blog.naibabiji.com/tutorial/install-bt.html) if text instructions aren't clear.)

![Server panel installation process](image/6729962797987.webp)

When prompted: `Do you want to install Bt-Panel to the /www directory now?(y/n):` type **y** and hit Enter.

Wait until you see this:

![Panel login credentials](image/09779089.webp)

Open the URL shown in your browser and log in.

![Panel login screen](image/9964606640.webp)

Accept the agreement and access the panel backend.

![Software stack selection](image/6077832092.webp)

A software installation prompt appears. **Choose PHP 7.4** (the screenshot is outdatedâ€”use 7.4 or higher). For database: MySQL 5.6 or 5.7 works, though newer versions run better on higher-spec servers. Nginx: stick with the recommended version. Click one-click install.

Installation takes 1-2 hours. Go do something else. We'll continue after it finishes. (Maybe handle the domain DNS setup described in the next section while you wait.)

Not a fan of this panel? Try [installing LNMP stack instead](https://blog.naibabiji.com/tutorial/an-zhuang-lnmp-tu-wen-jiao-cheng.html).

## Installing WordPress

Software installation complete? Time to get WordPress running.

### Part 1: Point Your Domain

Before installing anything, configure DNS. Add an A record at your domain registrar pointing to your server IP.

### Part 2: Add Your Site

![Adding a website in panel](image/23200990034775.webp)

In the panel: **Website** â†’ **Add Website**.

Enter your domain, create FTP and database credentials, then submit.

Once DNS propagates, visiting your domain shows this:

![Default panel landing page](image/38246802087.webp)

Site successfully added.

### Part 3: Configure SSL and Permalinks

Before installing WordPress, set up SSL certificates and permalink rules. More efficient this way.

**SSL Certificate Setup:** Back in the website list, click **Settings** next to your site, then select **SSL**.

![SSL certificate installation](image/34129661.webp)

The free Let's Encrypt certificate works perfectly. Have a paid certificate? Paste its contents here instead.

**Permalink Rules:** In panel backend: **Website** â†’ **Settings** (for your site) â†’ **Rewrite**, select **WordPress**, save.

![WordPress rewrite rules configuration](image/688402850361.webp)

### Part 4: WordPress Installation

#### Download WordPress

Upload locally or download directly to server. We'll use remote download. Navigate to your site's root directory:

![Accessing website root directory](image/980246612508767.webp)

Select **Download from URL**:

![Remote download interface](image/93004918.webp)

**WordPress download URL:** https://cn.wordpress.org/latest-zh_CN.zip

![Entering download URL](image/12696393889425.webp)

After download completes, click **Extract** next to the archive:

![Extracting WordPress files](image/32285001284.webp)

In the extraction window, click **Extract**.

![Extraction confirmation](image/639834183269964.webp)

Extraction creates a wordpress folder:

![WordPress folder in file manager](image/4157066083458732.webp)

Open the wordpress folder.

![Selecting all WordPress files](image/37029804.webp)

Check the box to select all files, click **Cut** in the top right.

![Navigating back to root directory](image/35444243.webp)

Click your domain name (red arrow) to return to the domain folder, then **Paste All**.

![Pasting WordPress files](image/3032649350134007.webp)

Your file manager should now look like this:

![Final WordPress file structure](image/5723968731181.webp)

Ready to install.

#### Browser Installation

Open your domain in a browser. Click "**Let's go!**"

![WordPress installation welcome screen](image/7533097371431279.webp)

Enter your database name, username, and password. Click **Submit**.

![WordPress database configuration](image/51670094873958.webp)

Correct credentials lead here. Click **Run the installation**.

![Installation ready confirmation](image/4161660573.webp)

Set your site title, admin username, password, and email. Click **Install WordPress**.

![WordPress site information setup](image/385012450214.webp)

Done. You can log in now.

![Installation success screen](image/89663537.webp)

**That's it.** Your Vultr-hosted WordPress site is live.

What's left? Customize your theme, tweak settings, add content. The hard part's over.

## One-Click WordPress Installation

The panel method gives you more control, but some people just want their site running without the headache. Here's the express lane.

During [server creation](#creating-your-server), when selecting your OS, switch to **Marketplace Apps** and choose **OpenLiteSpeed WordPress**. Deploy.

![One-click WordPress marketplace selection](image/0176080115037.webp)

After deployment, click your server in the list to view details.

![One-click WordPress server credentials](image/94610082283140.webp)

You'll see your IP, username, and password. Use Xshell to connect (see [Managing Your Server](#managing-your-server) section for Xshell setup).

![One-click installation welcome message](image/76304584.webp)

After connecting via Xshell, you'll see default WordPress information.

![One-click installation instructions](image/39492533125.webp)

The system explains where everything's installed and prompts you to enter a domain. It'll automatically configure DNS and SSL certificatesâ€”but only if you've already registered your domain and pointed it to your server IP.

Haven't done that yet? Either handle domain setup now, or press CTRL+C to skip (the prompt returns next login).

**Recommended approach:** Set up domain DNS first, wait a few minutes for propagation, then enter your domain in the prompt above. Access your site via domain, not IP.

DNS setup: Add an A record at your domain registrar pointing to your server IP.

After entering your domain and email when prompted, the system configures everything automatically. You'll see confirmation that certificates installed successfully.

Once complete, open your domain in a browser for the WordPress setup screen:

![WordPress installation information page](image/73038755490.webp)

The **Search engine visibility** checkbox is worth checking during developmentâ€”it prevents Google from indexing your incomplete site. Uncheck it in Settings once you're ready to launch.

**If you installed via IP first, then set up DNS later:** Manually update your site URLs in WordPress Settings to use your domain instead of the IP address.

![Updating WordPress site URLs](image/989399693.webp)

Done. WordPress is running.
